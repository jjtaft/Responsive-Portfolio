<h2>About Me</h2>

<p><img src="assets/images/mebrazil.jpg" id="me">Born in California and raised US Air Force which means I bounced around every few years due to the military brat status. I mostly lived in the Pacific and West Coast area's growing up as my father tried to keep us confined to a region. I attended college in California and received a degree in digital media communications.</p>

<p>After college, I've largely worked in project management which started in the banking industry and ended up in the aviation industry which is where I am now. I, also, recently began a journey of learning beginning with coding and development. My achievements include obtaining my Green Belt and completing the training, testing, and one of two projects toward my Black Belt in Lean Six Sigma. Also, nearing completion of my Project Manager Professional certification from the Project Management Institute. Finally, I'm an avid traveler that enjoys venturing off the beaten path as it continues to allow me to learn more about myself as a person and my relation to this amazing planet.</p>
